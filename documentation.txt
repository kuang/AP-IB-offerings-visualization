Data Parsing:
	Data source is a .xlxs file. Converting to csv.

Map issue:
	us.json (usa map file) does not have direct path-to-state correlation (ex. a "state" field)- only arbitrary ish ID numbers for each state. We solved this problem by finding a third party file source (us-state-names.tsv) that further correlates said ID numbers to state name Strings.
